<p>
The plan of the following Classification and Index was developed early in
1873. It was the result of several months' study of library economy as found in
some hundreds of books and pamphlets, and in over fifty personal visits to various
American libraries. In this study, the author became convinced that the usefulness
of these libraries might be greatly increased without additional expenditure.
Three years practical use of the system here explained, leads him to believe
that it will accomplish this result; for with its aid, the catalogues, shelf lists,
indexes, and cross-references essential to this increased usefulness, can be made
more economically than by any other method which he has been able to find.
The system was devised for cataloguing and indexing purposes, but it was
found on trial to be equally valuable for numbering and arranging books and
pamphlets on the shelves.</p>
<p>
The library is first divided into nine special libraries which are called Classes.
These Classes are Philosophy, Theology, &amp;c., and are numbered with the nine
digits. Thus Class 9 is the Library of History; Class 7, the Library of Fine
Art; Class 2, the Library of Theology. These special libraries or Classes are
then considered independently, and each one is separated again into nine special
Divisions of the main subject. These Divisions are numbered from 1 to 9 as
were the Classes. Thus 59 is the 9th Division (Zoology) of the 5th Class (Natural
Science). A final division is then made by separating each of these Divisions
into nine Sections which are numbered in the same way, with the nine digits.
Thus 513 is the 3d Section (Geometry) of the 1st Division (Mathematics) of the
5th Class (Natural Science). This number, giving Class, Division, and Section, is
called the Classification or Class Number, and is applied to every book or pamphlet
belonging to the library. All the Geometries are thus numbered 513, all the
Mineralogies 549, and so throughout the library, all the books on any given subject
bear the number of that subject in the scheme. Where a 0 occurs in a class
number, it has its normal zero power. Thus, a book numbered 510, is Class 5,
Division 1, but <i>no</i> Section. This signifies that the book treats of the Division 51
(Mathematics) in general, and is not limited to any one Section, as is the Geometry,
marked 513. If marked 500, it would indicate a treatise on Science in general,
limited to <i>no</i> Division. A zero occurring in the first place would in the same
way show that the book is limited to <i>no</i> Class. The classification is mainly made
by subjects or content regardless of <i>form</i>; but it is found practically useful to
make an additional distinction in these general treatises, according to the form
of treatment adopted. Thus, in Science we have a large number of books
treating of Science in general, and so having a 0 for the Division number.
These books are then divided into Sections, as are those of the other Classes
according to the form they have taken on. We have the Philosophy and History
of Science, Scientific Compends, Dictionaries, Essays, Periodicals, Societies,
Education, and Travels,--all having the common subject, <b>NATURAL SCIENCE</b>, but
treating it in these varied forms. These form distinctions are introduced here
because the number of general works is large, and the numerals allow of this
division, without extra labor for the numbers from 501 to 509 would otherwise
be unused. They apply <i>only</i> to the general treatises, which, without them,
would have a class number ending with two zeros. A Dictionary of Mathematics
is 510, not 503, for every book is assigned to the <i>most specific head that
will contain it</i>, so that 503 is limited to Dictionaries or Cyclopedias of Science <i>in
general</i>. In the same way a General Cyclopedia or Periodical treats of no one
class, and so is assigned to the Class 0. These books treating of no special class,
but general in their character, are divided into Cyclopedias, Periodicals, etc. No
difficulty is found in following the arithmetical law and omitting the initial zero,
so these numbers are printed 31, 32, etc., instead of 031, 032, etc.</p>
<p>
The selection and arrangement of the thousand headings of the classification
cannot be explained in detail for want of space. In all the work, philosophical
theory and accuracy have been made to yield to practical usefulness. The impossibility
of making a satisfactory classification of all knowledge as preserved in
books, has been appreciated from the first, and nothing of the kind attempted.
Theoretical harmony and exactness has been repeatedly sacrificed to the practical
requirements of the library or to the convenience of the department in the college.
As in every scheme, many minor subjects have been put under general heads to
which they do not strictly belong. In some cases these headings have been
printed in a distinctive type, e. g., 429 <b>Anglo-Saxon</b>, under <b>ENGLISH PHILOLOGY</b>.
The rule has been to assign these subjects to the most nearly allied heads, or
where it was thought they would be most useful. The only alternative was to
omit them altogether. If any such omission occurs, it is unintentional and will
be supplied as soon as discovered. Wherever practicable the heads have been so
arranged that each subject is preceded and followed by the most nearly allied
subjects and thus the greatest convenience is secured both in the catalogues and
on the shelves. Theoretically, the division of every subject into just nine
heads is absurd. Practically, it is desirable that the classification be as minute
as possible without the use of additional figures, and the decimal principle
on which our scheme hinges allows nine divisions as readily as a less number.
This principle has proved wholly satisfactory in practice though it appears
to destroy proper co-ordination in some places. It has seemed best in our
library to use uniformly three figures in the class number. This enables us
to classify certain subjects very minutely, giving, for example, an entire section
to Chess. But the History of England has only one section, as our scheme is
developed, and thus the two might be said to be co-ordinated. The apparent
difficulty in such cases is entirely obviated by the use of a fourth figure, giving
nine sub-sections to any subject of sufficient importance to warrant closer classification.
In history where the classification is made wholly by countries, a fourth
figure is added to give a division into <i>periods</i>. As the addition of each figure
gives a ten-fold division, any desired degree of minuteness may be secured in
the classing of special subjects. The apparent lack of co-ordination arises from
the fact that only the first three figures of these more important heads are as
yet printed, the fourth figure and the sub-sections being supplied on the catalogues
in manuscript. Should the growth of any of these sub-sections warrant
it, a fifth figure will be added, for the scheme admits of expansion without limit.</p>
<p>
The arrangement of headings has been sometimes modified to secure a mnemonic
aid in numbering and finding books without the Index. For instance, the scheme
is so arranged that China has always the number 1. In Ancient History,
it has the first section, 931: in Modern History, under Asia, it has 951: in
Philology, the Chinese language appears as 491. After the same manner the
Indian number is 2; Egyptian, 4; English, 2; German, 3; French, 4; Italian, 5;
Spanish, 6; European, 4; Asian, 5; African, 6; North American, 7; South
American, 8; and so for all the divisions by languages or countries. The Italian
5, for instance, will be noticed in 35, 55, 450, 755, 850, and 945. This mnemonic
principle is specially prominent in Philology and Literature and their divisions, and
in the <i>form</i> distinctions used in the first 9 sections of each class. Materials, Methods,
or Theory occurring anywhere as a head, bears always the number 1. Dictionaries
and Cyclopedias, 3; Essays, 4; Periodicals, 5; Associations, Institutions, and Societies,
6; Education, 7; Collections, 9. In the numerous cases where several minor
heads have been grouped together under the head Other, it always bears the number
9. Wherever practicable, this principle is carried out in sub-dividing the
sections. For instance, the Geology of North America, which bears the number
557 is sub-divided by adding the <i>sections</i> of 970 (History of North America).
The Geology of Mexico then bears the number 5578: mnemonically,
the first 5 is the Science number; the second 5, Geology; the 7, North America;
and the 8, Mexico. Any library attendant or reader after using the scheme a
short time will recognize at a glance, any catalogue or ledger entry, book or pamphlet,
marked 5578 as something on the Geology of Mexico. Users of the
scheme will notice this mnemonic principle in several hundred places in the
classification, and will find it of great practical utility in numbering and finding
books without the aid of Catalogue or Index, and in determining the character of
any book simply from its call number as recorded on the book, on all its catalogue
and cross reference cards, on the ledger, and in the check box.</p>
<p>
In naming the headings, brevity has been secured in many cases at the sacrifice
of exactness. It was thought more important to have short, familiar titles
for the headings than that the names given should express with fullness and
exactness the character of all books catalogued under them. Many subjects,
apparently omitted, will be found in the Index, assigned, with allied subjects, to
a heading which bears the name of the most important only. Reference to this
Subject Index will decide at once any doubtful points.</p>
<p>
In arranging books in the classification, as in filling out the scheme, practical
usefulness has been esteemed the most important thing. The effort has been to
put each book under the subject to the student of which it would be most useful.
The content or the real subject of which a book treats, and not the form or the
accidental wording of the title, determines its place. Following this rule, a Philosophy
of Art is put with Art, not with Philosophy; a History of Mathematics,
with Mathematics, not with History; for the philosophy and history are simply
the <i>form</i> which these books have taken. The true content or subject is Art, and
Mathematics, and to the student of these subjects they are most useful. The
predominant tendency or obvious purpose of the book, usually decides its class
number at once; still many books treat of two or more different subjects, and
in such cases it is assigned to the place where it will be most useful, and
underneath the class number are written the numbers of any other subjects
on which it also treats. These <i>Cross References</i> are given both on the plate
and the subject card as well as on the cross reference card. If a book treats of a
majority of the sections of any division, it is given the Division number instead
of the most important Section number with cross references.</p>
<p>
Collected works, libraries, etc., are either kept together and assigned like
individual books to the most specific head that will contain them; or assigned to
the most prominent of the various subjects on which they treat with cross references
from the others; or are separated and the parts classed as independent
works. Translations are classed with their originals.</p>
<p>
The Alphabetical Subject Index is designed to guide, both in numbering and
in finding the books. In numbering, the most specific head that will contain
the book having been determined, reference to that head in the Index will give
the class number to which it should be assigned. In finding books on any given
subject, reference to the Index will give the number under which they are to be
sought on the shelves, in the Shelf Catalogue, or in the Subject Catalogue. The
Index gives after each subject the number of the class to which it is assigned.
Most names of countries, towns, animals, plants, minerals, diseases, &amp;c, have
been omitted, the aim being to furnish an Index of Subjects on which books
are written, and not a Gazetteer or a Dictionary of all the nouns in the language.
Such subjects will be found as special chapters or sections of books on the
subjects given in the Index. The names of individual subjects of biographies
will be found in the Class List of Biography. Omissions of any of the more
general subjects will be supplied when brought to notice.</p>
<p>
In arranging the books on the shelves, the absolute location by shelf and book
number is wholly abandoned, the relative location by class and book number
being one of the most valuable features of the plan. The class number serves
also as the location number and the shelf number in common use is entirely dispensed
with. Accompanying the class number is the <i>book</i> number, which prevents
confusion of different books on the same subject. Thus the first Geometry
catalogued is marked 513-1; the second 513-2, and so on to any extent, the last
number showing how many books the library has on that subject. The books of
each section are all together, and arranged by book numbers, and these sections
are also arranged in simple numerical order throughout the library. The call
number 513-11 signifies not the 11th book on shelf 513; or alcove 5, range
1, shelf 3, as in most libraries, but signifies the 11th book in subject 513 or the
11th Geometry belonging to the library. In finding the book, the printed numbers
on the backs are followed, the upper being the class and the lower the book
number. The class is found in its numerical order among the classes as the shelf
is found in the ordinary system: the book in its numerical order in the class.
The shelves are not numbered, as the increase of different departments, the opening
of new rooms, and any arrangement of classes to bring the books most circulated
nearest to the delivery desk, will bring different class numbers on a given
shelf. New books as received are numbered and put into place, in the same way
that new titles are added to the card catalogue.</p>
<p>
The single digit occasionally prefixed to the book number, e.g. the 3 in 421-3-7
is the nearest height in decimeters of books too large to be put on the regular
library shelves, which are only 2&frac12; decimeters apart. The great mass of the
library consists of 2-decimeter books, the size numbers of which are omitted.
Books from 2&frac12; to 3&frac12; decimeters in height have 3 prefixed to the book number,
and are found on the bottom shelf of each range. The larger sizes are prefixed
with 4, 5, &amp;c., and are found on the special shelves provided, in order to avoid
the great waste of space otherwise occasioned by the relative location. By this
use of the size numbers a close economy of space is secured.</p>
<p>
Thus all the books on any given subject are found standing together, and no
additions or changes ever separate them. Not only are all the books on the subject
sought, found together, but the most nearly allied subjects precede and follow,
they in turn being preceded and followed by other allied subjects as far as
practicable. Readers not having access to the shelves find the short titles arranged
in the same order on the Shelf Catalogue, and the full titles, imprints, cross references,
notes, &amp;c., on the Subject Catalogue. The uncatalogued pamphlets treating
of any subject bear the same class number and are arranged on the shelves immediately
after the books of each section.</p>
<p>
In both the Authors' Catalogue and the Subject Index, brevity has been studied
because of the economy, but more because of the much greater ease of reference
to a short title catalogue. The custom of giving full titles, etc., under
authors, and only references or very brief titles under subjects, has been reversed.
A reader seeking a book of a <i>known author</i>, in the vast majority of cases, wants
simply the number by which to call for it, and can find it much sooner in a brief
title catalogue. In the rare cases where more is needed the class number refers
instantly to all these facts on the cards. On the other hand, a reader seeking
books on a <i>known subject</i>, needs the full title, imprint, cross-references, and notes,
to enable him to choose the book best suited to his wants.</p>
<p>
The Subject Catalogue is a full title Shelf List on cards and is for the use of
the public. The Shelf List is a short title Subject Catalogue in book form, made
of separate sheets laced into an Emerson binder, and is for official use. We thus
have without extra labor, both full and short title Subject Catalogues and Shelf
Lists. The public Authors' Catalogue is a printed volume; the official Authors'
Catalogue or Index is on cards. As a result each of the public Catalogues is
checked by an official Catalogue; each of the card Catalogues by a book Catalogue;
each of the brief title catalogues by a full title catalogue--an advantage
that will be appreciated by all librarians desiring accuracy of administration and
catalogues.</p>
<p>
The Arabic numerals can be written and found more quickly, and with less
danger of confusion or mistake, than any other symbols whatever. Therefore the
Roman numerals, capitals and small letters, and similar symbols usually found in
systems of classification are entirely discarded and by the exclusive use of Arabic
numerals in their regular order throughout the shelves, classifications, indexes,
catalogues and records, there is secured the greatest accuracy, economy, and convenience.
This advantage is specially prominent in comparison with systems
where the name of the author or the title must be written in calling for or
charging books and in making references.</p>
<p>
Throughout the catalogues the number of a book shows not only <i>where</i> it is but
<i>what</i> it is. On the library accounts the character of each person's reading is
clearly indicated by the numbers charged, and the minutest statistics of circulation
in any subject are made by simply counting the call slips in the check box,
and recording the number against the class number in the record.</p>
<p>
By the use of size numbers the greatest possible economy of space may be
secured, for the size distinction may be made for every inch or even less if desired,
and this without additional labor, as it will be seen that the size figure, when introduced,
requires one less figure in the book number, and so does not increase the
number of digits as would at first appear.</p>
<p>
Parts of sets, and books on the same or allied subjects, are never separated as
they are sure to be, sooner or later, in every library arranged on the common plan,
unless it be frequently re-arranged and re-catalogued. The great expense of this
re-cataloguing makes it impracticable except for a few very wealthy libraries.
In this system the catalogue and book numbers remain unchanged through all
changes of shelving, buildings, or arrangement. In addition to its own peculiar
merits, this plan has all the advantages of the card catalogue principle and of
the relative location, which have been used and very strongly approved by prominent
libraries.</p>
<p>
As in the card catalogue system, there is room for indefinite expansion without
devices or provisions. Space is the only requisite and if the shelf room is
exhausted, the floor space is equally good, except for the inconvenience of
stooping.</p>
<p>
Some prominent opponents of classed catalogues have admitted that the Subject
Index, in deciding where to class a book at first, and where to look for it ever
afterwards, has removed their strongest objections. Certainly it would be impossible
to make an Index more cheaply or more easy of reference, it being a
single alphabet, of single words, followed by single numbers.</p>
<p>
These class numbers applied to pamphlets have proved specially satisfactory.
The number is written on the upper left corner and the pamphlets are arranged
either in pamphlet cases with the books on the same subject or on special
shelves divided every decimeter by perpendicular sections. As each pamphlet is
examined when received into the library, it is the work of a single moment to
pencil on it its class number. There is no expense whatever incurred, and yet
the entire pamphlet resources of the library on any subject can be produced
almost instantly. The immense advantages of this plan over those in common
use, both in economy and usefulness, will be appreciated by every librarian caring
for a pamphlet collection. A catalogue of authors may be made on slips if
desired. The pamphlets themselves are the best Subject Catalogue.</p>
<p>
Though designed wholly for library use, the plan has proved of great service
in preserving newspaper clippings in large envelopes arranged by class numbers;
and more especially in taking the place of the common note-book and Index Rerum.
Slips of uniform size are used with the class number of the subject written on the
corner. Minute alphabetical headings are used under each class number, the
slips being arranged in numerical order like the Subject Card Catalogue. Clippings
and notes arranged in this way are at all times their own complete index, and
have the same advantages over the common scrap and note-books that the Subject
Catalogue has over the Accessions Book, in looking up the resources of the
library on any given subject. Those who have tried this method are so enthusiastic
in its praise that it seemed worthy of mention in this place.</p>
<p>
The plan was adopted in the Amherst College Library in 1873, and the work
of transferring the entire library to the new catalogue at once commenced. It
was found entirely practicable to make the change gradually, as means allowed,
without interfering in any appreciable degree with the circulation of the books.
The three years trial to which it has been there subjected has more than justified
the claims of its friends, and it is now printed with the more confidence on this
account. It has been kept in manuscript up to this time, in order that the many
minor details might be subjected to actual trial and modified where improvement
was possible. The labor involved in preparing the Classification and Index has
been wholly beyond the appreciation of any who have never attempted a similar
task. Much valuable aid has been rendered by specialists in many departments,
and nearly every member of the Faculty has given advice from time to time.
Among the many to whom thanks are due, special mention should be made of
Mr. C.A. Cutter, the librarian of the Boston Athen&aelig;um, and Mr. John Fiske,
of the Harvard University library, for valuable suggestions and appreciative criticism.
While these friends are in no way responsible for any remaining imperfections
in the scheme, they should have credit for many improvements which have
been made during these three years of revision. The essential character of
the plan has remained unchanged from the first. Doubtless other improvements
are still possible, and it is hoped that users of the scheme will call attention to any
proposed change in the naming or arrangement of the headings, or to any omission
which should be supplied in the Subject Index.</p>
<p>
Before printing, the plan was submitted to quite a number of librarians for
criticism. Among the hundreds of points raised as to its practical workings
and usefulness there was only one in which it was not shown to be equal or
superior to any other system known. This objection applied only to the arrangement
on the shelves; not at all to the catalogues or indexes. It was, that in this
relative location, a book which this year stands, e.g., at the end of a certain shelf;
may not be on that shelf at all another year, because of the uneven growth of
the parts of the library. This slight objection inheres in any system where the
books are arranged by <i>subjects</i> rather than by windows, doors, shelves, and similar
non-intellectual distinctions.</p>
<p>
In this hurriedly prepared account of his plan, the author has doubtless failed
to meet many objections which may be raised and which he could easily answer.
He would therefore ask the privilege of replying personally to any such objections,
where they arise, believing that it will be possible to answer, if not all, at least a
very large proportion.</p>
<p>
In his varied reading, correspondence, and conversation on the subject, the
author doubtless received suggestions and gained ideas which it is now impossible
for him to acknowledge. Perhaps the most fruitful source of ideas was the <i>Nuovo
Sistema di Catalogo Bibliografico Generale</i> of Natale Battezzati, of Milan. Certainly
he is indebted to this system adopted by the Italian publishers in 1871, though he
has copied nothing from it. The plan of the St. Louis Public School Library,
and that of the Apprentices' Library of New York, which in some respects resemble
his own, were not seen till all the essential features were decided upon, though
not given to the public. In filling the nine classes of the scheme the inverted
Baconian arrangement of the St. Louis Library has been followed. The author
has no desire to claim original invention for any part of his system where another
has been before him, and would most gladly make specific acknowledgment of
every aid and suggestion were it in his power to do so. With these general
explanations and acknowledgments he submits the scheme, hoping it may prove
as useful to others as it has to himself.<br /><br />

<h2><a name="EXPLANATIONS">EXPLANATIONS</a></h2>
<p>
The titles of the subject catalogue are exact transcriptions of the title
page, neither amended, translated, or in any way altered, except that
mottoes, titles of authors, repetitions, or matter of any kind not
essential to a clear titular description, are <i>omitted</i>. Omissions of
mottoes are indicated by three stars (* * *); of other matter by three
dots (...). The phraseology, spelling, and punctuation of the title
are exactly copied; but capitals are given only to proper names and
adjectives, and initial words of sentences. Any additions needed to make
the title clear are supplied and enclosed by brackets.</p>
<p>
After the titles, are given in order: the place of publication; the year;
the year of copyright, if different, in brackets; the edition; the number
of volumes, or of pages if in only one volume; the illustrations, maps,
plates, or portraits; and the size nearest in the arbitrary scale,
regardless of the fold of the sheet. This scale gives the heights in
decimeters. Square and oblong books have the size prefixed by <i>sq</i>. or
<i>ob</i>. Books 1 decimeter high are called 32; 1.5 deci., 16; 2 deci.,
12; 2.5 deci., 8; 3 deci., 4; and all others are marked simply by the
nearest height, i.e. a book marked 4 is between 3.5 and 4.5 decimeters
high. In books having more than one pagination the number of pages is
indicated by giving the last number of each pagination connected by a +;
an added + indicates additional matter unpaged.</p>
<p>
These imprint entries give the facts regardless of the title page, and
are left blank only when they can be ascertained neither from the book
itself or other sources.</p>
<p>
The contents of volumes are given when on title pages, or when necessary
to properly identify the volume, but no analysis is attempted. Necessary
notes are given at the bottom of the subject card after the imprint
entries.</p>
<p>
Duplicates are simply marked copy 2, copy 3, etc., and bear the same
class and book number, but editions of the same book distinct in
character are catalogued separately.</p>
<p>
In all the catalogues, books are entered under the <i>surnames</i> of authors
when known; under the <i>initials</i> of author's names, when these only
appear, the last initial being put first; under the <i>pseudonyms</i> of the
writers, when the real names are not ascertained; under the names
of <i>editors</i> of collections; under the names of <i>countries, cities,
societies,</i> or other <i>bodies</i> which are responsible for their
publication; under the <i>first word</i> not an article of the titles of
periodicals and of anonymous books the names of whose authors are not
ascertained. <i>Commentaries</i> with the text, and <i>translations</i> are
entered under the heading of the original work, but commentaries without
the text are entered under the name of the <i>commentator</i>. The Bible or
any part of it in any language is entered under the word <i>Bible</i>. Books
having more than one author are entered under the first named on the
title.</p>
<p>
In the headings of titles, the names of authors are given in their
vernacular form. In English and French surnames beginning with a prefix
(except the French de and d') the name is recorded under the prefix. In
other languages and in French names beginning with de and d', the name
is recorded under the word following the prefix. Compound surnames are
entered under the first part of the name. Noblemen and ecclesiastical
dignitaries are entered under their family names, but <i>sovereigns,
princes, oriental writers, friars, persons canonized</i>, and all other
persons known <i>only</i> by their first name, are entered under this first
name.</p>
<p>
The catalogue is not a biographical dictionary, so only gives the names
of authors with sufficient fullness to distinguish them from each other
in practical use.</p>
<p>
Names in <b>full face type</b> are the ruling headings under which the books
are entered in the various catalogues. Entries not beginning with this
type are in addition to the first or main entry, and are made under the
names of <i>translators, editors, commentators, continuators</i>, etc., as
participators in the authorship; also in the case of books having more
than one author, or having both generic and specific titles, or published
by societies or other bodies, and having also the name of the individual
author. These additional entries are made in order to carry out the plan
of the Authors' Catalogue, which aims to give under each author's name
all his works which the library contains.</p>
<p>
The works of an author known by more than one name are given all
together, under the form of name chosen. Any other name or title by which
he may be known, if it differs in the first three letters, is entered in
its alphabetical place, followed by the word <i>see</i> and the name under
which the books are entered. Such cross references have no titles given
under them, but are simply guides to the name chosen.</p>
<p>
A single dash indicates the omission of the preceding heading; a
subsequent dash indicates the omission of a subordinate heading or of a
title. A dash connecting numbers signifies <i>to and including</i>; following
a number it signifies <i>continuation</i>. A ? following a word or entry
signifies <i>probably</i>. Brackets enclose words added to titles or changed
in form.</p>
<p>
The German diphthongs , ,  are written, ae, oe, ue.</p>
<p>
Dates are all given in years of the common calendar, and Arabic numerals
are uniformly used for all numbers.</p>

<br /><br />
<h2><a name="SUBJECTCATALOGUE">SUBJECT CATALOGUE</a></h2>
<p>
The Subject Catalogue on large cards can be used to advantage only with
the aid of the <i>Classification</i> or <i>Index</i>. To find what the library
has on any given subject, get from the Index the class number of that
subject. Under this number in the Subject Catalogue will be found the
full titles of the books, with imprints, cross references, and notes. The
class number, by which the cards are arranged, is given in the upper
left corner and immediately under it is the book number. Any other class
number given in the left hand margin refers to another subject of which
the book also treats. When the class number at the top is followed by an
additional figure in brackets, the subject as given in the printed scheme
has been subdivided in arranging the cards. This subdivision will be
found on the first card of the catalogue which bears this class number.
These figures in brackets determine the arrangement of the titles in the
Catalogue, but on the shelves, in the Shelf Catalogue, and in calling for
and charging books, they are entirely disregarded. Thus a book numbered
942(7).14 would be in the Catalogue among the 942 cards arranged by the
figure in brackets as though it were a decimal, but it would be called
for as 942.14, the brackets indicating that the final classing was
limited to the Catalogue and was not extended to the shelves. If a fourth
figure is added without brackets, the final classing is extended to the
shelves as well as to the catalogue, and all the figures must be used
in calling for the book. In such cases the added figure is treated as a
decimal in the arrangement, though the decimal point is not written.</p>
<p>
The last card which bears any class number, gives under that number,
followed by the word SEE the call numbers of other books which treat of
the same subject, but are classed elsewhere. General cross references
are also made in many cases without specifying individual books, as from
<i>Commerce</i> as a question of SOCIAL SCIENCE (380) to <i>Commerce</i> as a
USEFUL ART, Book-keeping Business Manuals, etc. (650). In such cases
there is a card under 380 marked SEE 650, and under 650 there is a card
marked SEE 380. From whatever stand-point a subject is approached, the
cross references guide at once to the same subject treated in its other
relations. These cross references both general and specific are often
accompanied by brief notes, characterizing the books to which reference
is made.</p>
<p>
There will be found at the beginning of many class numbers, a card noting
the most reliable books on that subject, and the best of the articles in
periodicals, transactions, and collected works with the volume and page
where they may be found. It is hoped to give special prominence to these
notes for the guidance of readers, and they will be added as rapidly as
other duties allow.</p>
<p>
Many subjects will have no sub-section cards at the beginning; some will
have no reference cards at the end; and some may have no titles given
under the number. The scheme provides a place for books on all subjects,
whether the library has them or not, so where no titles are given under
a class number it shows that the library has as yet no books on that
subject.</p>
<p>
Articles in periodicals and transactions, separate volumes of sets and
collections which are located together, <i>if catalogued</i> are put under
their proper subject number, but no <i>book number</i> is given with it. The
call number of the book, where they may be found, is always given in the
margin preceded by the word IN. In the same way special chapters in books
will sometimes be catalogued, <i>e.g.</i> a card marked 338 IN 331-27, would
mean that in the 27 books on 331, <i>Capital and Labor</i>, there was a
chapter on 338, <i>Production</i>.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
